Output:

find_for_the_flag_you_are_almost_there_gth2f6Pt0oHTDhQQKHnkDhWsHyTHp5uxKgAepHQKS2gtA/CC

There is still a part that not fully decrypted.

2.	Decode again using Atom

gth2f6Pt0oHTDhQQKHnkDhWsHyTHp5uxKgAepHQKS2gtA/CC

Output:

S1BNR3tuMHRIaW5HX2VsUzNfaDNyRX0=

As we know, this is Base 64 (It have = at the end).

3.	Decode using Base 64

Now we use another tools, Cyber Chef

Output:
KPMG{n0tHinG_elS3_h3rE}
Here our flag.

Flag : KPMG{n0tHinG_elS3_h3rE}
